I am a **software developer** based in Vancouver, BC who  I recently graduated from [Simon Fraser University](https://www.sfu.ca/). Most of my experiences are software development and data science but I recently started expanding skills by exploring the realm of web development.

When I am not programming, I love to go bouldering and sharing silly photos of my cat.
