I am a **QA Engineer** based in Vancouver, BC who I graduated from [Simon Fraser University](https://www.sfu.ca/) in 2019. My main focus is automation, front-end and accessibility testing.

When I am not programming, I enjoy bouldering. I use my bouldering time more as a meditative time where I focus on problems and listen to podcasts ([Reply All](https://gimletmedia.com/shows/reply-all), [Talking Simpsons](https://talkingsimpsons.libsyn.com/), [Ologies](https://www.alieward.com/ologies) are some of my favorites). Other than that I love embarassing my cat and sharing silly photos.
